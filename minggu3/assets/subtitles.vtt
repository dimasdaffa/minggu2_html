00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.400
Every time I open my mouth

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.250
I have regrets in my mind

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.000
Every time

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.900
And no one seems to figure me out

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.300
I guess it's stress

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.000
It's making me feel so depressed

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.300
Most my life, I felt so tired

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.100
But every now and then
when I try, I say

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.000
Keep it up and go on

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.900
You're only holding out
for what you want

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.700
You no longer owe the strangers

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.600
It's enough, it's enough

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.600
Keep it up and go on

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.600
Yeah, you're only holding
out for what you want

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.300
I know that it's so frustrating

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.900
It's enough, keep it up

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.100
Now I'm here and I wish that I wasn't

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.400
I'm in a place in front of a dozen

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.400
People I've nevеr met

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.800
And I don't know if this is correct

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.800
I guess I'm blеssed

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.400
I never give myself respect

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.100
Most my life I'm asking why

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.300
But anytime I give it a try, I say

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.100
Keep it up and go on

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.000
You're only holding out
for what you want

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.700
You no longer owe the strangers

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800
It's enough, it's enough

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.800
Keep it up and go on

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.700
Yeah, you're only holding
out for what you want

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.300
I know that it's so frustrating

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.900
It's enough, keep it up

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.200
Yeah, it's enough

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.700
I've really had enough

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.400
I paid the price, I'm done, no

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.500
Keep it up and go on

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.400
You're only holding out
for what you want

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.100
You no longer owe the strangers

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.500
It's enough, it's enough

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.600
Keep it up and go on

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.900
Yeah, you're only holding
out for what you want

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.600
I know that it's so frustrating

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.250
It's enough, keep it up

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.100
It's enough, it's enough

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.550
Keep it up, keep it up

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.500
No, no, mm-mm
